COMPUTER ENGINEERING WORKSHOP (CEW) 
LAB 1 
EXERCISES
1. Write a C program that accepts an employee's ID, total worked hours in a month and
the amount received per hour. Print the ID and salary (with two decimal places) of the
employee for a particular month.
2. Write a C program that takes the height and width of a rectangle as an input from user
and compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
3. Write a C program to accept the height of a person in centimeters and categorize the
person according to his height. (Height < 150cm – Dwarf, Height=150cm – Average,
Height>=165cm – Tall).
4. Write a program in C to convert a decimal number to a binary number using functions.
5. Write a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number and call it recursively to print
the Fibonacci series.

LAB 2
EXERCISES
1. Write a C program to display the first n odd natural numbers and their sum using for, while and
do-while loop.
2. Write a C program to make the following pattern as a pyramid with an asterisk.
   *
  * *
 * * *
* * * *
3. Write a C program to compare two strings without using string library functions.
4. Write a C program to read a sentence and replace lowercase characters with uppercase and vice
versa.
5. Write a C program to print all unique elements in an array.

LAB 3
EXERCISES
1. Write a program in C to swap elements using call by reference.
2. Write a program in C to print a string in reverse using pointers.
3.Write a C program to input and print array elements using pointers.
4. Write a C program to search for an element in an array using pointers. 

LAB 4
EXERCISES
1. Write a program that simulates a simple address book. Define a structure to store contact
information (name, email, phone number). Allow the user to add new contacts to the
address book dynamically. Use dynamic memory allocation for storing the contacts using
malloc and update the memory allocation using realloc when adding new contacts.
Implement an option to delete a contact and free the memory. Ensure that memory is
properly managed throughout the program's execution.
2. Write a C program to merge two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted linked list.
3. Write a C program that converts a singly linked list into an array and returns it.
4. Write a C program that removes elements with odd indices from a singly linked list.__________________________________________________________________________
